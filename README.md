In our information era, the volume of scientific literature grows at an ever-increasing speed. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the number of papers grows exponentially and doubles approximately every 23 months. In this overflow of information, researchers have to specialize in narrow sub-disciplines, making it challenging to uncover scientific concepts and connections beyond their own area of research. To explore beyond the specialized areas, research ideas need to transcend the individual focus bubbles. A tool that could offer such meaningful, personalized scientific ideas would open new avenues of research.
