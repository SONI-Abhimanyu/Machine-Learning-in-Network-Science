# Machine-Learning-in-Network-Science
Science4cast Competition:
In our information era, the volume of scientific literature grows at an ever-increasing speed. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the number of papers grows exponentially and doubles approximately every 23 months. In this overflow of information, researchers have to specialize in narrow sub-disciplines, making it challenging to uncover scientific concepts and connections beyond their own area of research. To explore beyond the specialized areas, research ideas need to transcend the individual focus bubbles. A tool that could offer such meaningful, personalized scientific ideas would open new avenues of research.

The competition goal is to capture the evolution of scientific concepts and predict which research topics will emerge in the coming years. We created a semantic network characterizing the content of scientific literature in AI since 1994. The network contains 64,000 nodes, each representing an AI concept. Edges between nodes are drawn when two concepts are investigated together in a scientific paper. Competitors need to predict future states of this exponentially growing semantic network.
